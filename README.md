## Week1: The process of using a 3D scanner
1. We first tried using a 3D scanner, and the first problem we found was that it requires a LiDAR device, which not all phones or tablets have.
2. After finding the right device, we scanned objects in our dorm room, but instead of getting a single object as we wanted, the scan captured the entire room.
3. So we borrowed a 3D scanner from our teacher. At first, we scanned a pen, but since it was lying flat, it was hard to separate it from the tray.
4. Then we tried scanning a thermos cup, but it was too big, so we had to rotate the 3D scanner 90 degrees to capture it.
5. We also found that the 3D scanner couldn’t clearly recognize the strap of the thermos, and it ended up generating multiple straps.
6. Finally, we removed the strap and got a relatively good 3D model. However, the top and bottom that weren’t scanned were left open, turning it into an unsealed cavity, and we weren’t able to fix this problem.

## Week2:3D printing
1. Firstly, we processed the 3D model obtained through scanning using Autodesk meshmixer.

2. Then we import the obtained 3D model file into the 3D printer.

3. During the use of the printer, we encountered a problem: the printed material could not adhere well to the base plate, resulting in printing failure.

4. By asking the teacher, we learned that it was because the distance between the nozzle and the base plate was too far. After adjusting the height of the nozzle, the printing proceeded smoothly.

5. After about an hour of printing, we obtained a model of the thermos cup reduced to a quarter.

## Week3: Laser Cutting 
1. Firstly, we used a vernier caliper to measure the wooden board and found that its thickness was approximately 2.74mm.

2. We conducted a preliminary design of the kerf testing piece using Adobe illustrator, with scales ranging from 2.62mm to 2.84mm and graduations of 0.02mm.

3. The kerf testing piece was obtained by cutting the wooden board with a laser cutting machine, but we found that the smallest size was still larger than the thickness of the wooden board.

4. So we redesigned the kerf testing piece, with dimensions ranging from 2.15mm to 2.70mm and a scale of 0.05. This time we got that 2.40mm is just right to fit the wooden board in.
