## The record of the first week: The process of using a 3D scanner
1. We first tried using a 3D scanner, and the first problem we found was that it requires a LiDAR device, which not all phones or tablets have.
2. After finding the right device, we scanned objects in our dorm room, but instead of getting a single object as we wanted, the scan captured the entire room.
3. So we borrowed a 3D scanner from our teacher. At first, we scanned a pen, but since it was lying flat, it was hard to separate it from the tray.
4. Then we tried scanning a thermos cup, but it was too big, so we had to rotate the 3D scanner 90 degrees to capture it.
5. We also found that the 3D scanner couldn’t clearly recognize the strap of the thermos, and it ended up generating multiple straps.
6. Finally, we removed the strap and got a relatively good 3D model. However, the top and bottom that weren’t scanned were left open, turning it into an unsealed cavity, and we weren’t able to fix this problem.
